function added = setup_path(options)
% SETUP_PATH  Put the macro model's code folders on the MATLAB path.
%
%   setup_path            adds the folders if they are not already there
%   setup_path('force',true)   re-adds them even if present
%   added = setup_path(...)    returns the folders actually added
%
% Run once per MATLAB session before using the model, or let any entry point
% call it for you -- run_full_workflow, calibrate_growth_model, ramsey_trend,
% build_population_projection, generate_frozen_model, postestimation_analysis
% and the exporters all call it defensively at their top, so the usual workflow
% needs no manual setup.
%
% WHY THIS IS NEEDED
%   MATLAB's addpath is NOT recursive, and the model's code lives in
%   subfolders (internal/, diagnostics/, tests/, documentation_tables/). Only
%   the current folder is searched automatically, so without this call a
%   function in one of those subfolders is simply "undefined".
%
%   Folders are resolved from this file's own location, not from pwd, so the
%   call works from anywhere. The DATA paths inside the model are a different
%   matter: they are pwd-relative by design (fullfile('country_params', ...),
%   'data_for_dynare_%s.csv', ...), and Dynare writes its own output into pwd
%   unconditionally. The working directory therefore still has to be this
%   folder when running the pipeline. setup_path only fixes code resolution.
%
% NOTE ON genpath
%   genpath deliberately skips +package, @class and private folders. That is
%   what we want: Dynare's generated +Macromodel_* packages must be reached
%   through their parent, not added directly.

    % or be shadowed unpredictably.
