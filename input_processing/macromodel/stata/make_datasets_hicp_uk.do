// Seasonally adjusts the UK price level with X-13ARIMA-SEATS and aggregates it to
// quarterly means. Writes hicp_q_sa_uk.dta, which make_datasets.do merges as the UK's
// DSGE price level. make_datasets.do runs this file when country is UK and
// do_HICP_seasonal_adjustment = 1; Stata's working directory must be
// input_processing/macromodel/stata/. The X-13 binary and spec are in x13_settings.do,
// shared with make_datasets_hicp.do, so the UK is adjusted like every other country.
//
// WHY THE UK HAS ITS OWN FILE. Eurostat's UK HICP (the HICP_UK column of HICP.dta,
// written by make_datasets_hicp.do, and hicp_uk_sa in hicp_q_sa.dta) stops at 2020m11:
// Eurostat stopped publishing UK data after Brexit. The ONS CPI is the UK's HICP under
// its national name, the series Eurostat itself published as the UK HICP: in all 299
// months of 1996m1-2020m11 ONS D7BT equals Eurostat's M.HICP2015.NSA.CP-HI00.UK exactly. The UK therefore takes D7BT (CPI INDEX 00: ALL ITEMS 2015=100, not seasonally
// adjusted) for the whole sample, with no splicing. The UK columns of HICP.dta and
// hicp_q_sa.dta are not read.
//
// AGAINST TRAMO/SEATS. Until 2026-10 the other countries were adjusted with EViews'
// TRAMO/SEATS, and the UK was the first on X-13. X-13 pre-adjusts with regARIMA rather
// than TRAMO, and the two pick different models. Measured on Eurostat's UK HICP over
// 2000q1-2020q3 (2026-10 vintage), Q-o-Q annualised inflation from this X-13 path and
// from the EViews TRAMO/SEATS series differed by a mean of 0.00 pp and an RMSE of
// 0.54 pp, against 0.001 pp (Sweden) to 0.26 pp (Spain) for the other four countries
// over their estimation samples (make_datasets_hicp.do). The gap is noise between two
// valid adjustments, not a bias: neither leaves residual seasonality (regressing
// quarterly inflation on quarter dummies gives p > 0.9 for both, over 2000q1-2020q3 and
// over 2010q1-2020q3), and X-13's own test finds none either.
//
// SPAN. 1996m1-2025m12, the span make_datasets_hicp.do adjusts the other countries on,
// so a new ONS release does not move the fit unless the span is moved deliberately.
