% MARK_BUNDLE_UNVERIFIED  Record inside an export bundle that it must not ship.
%
%   mark_bundle_unverified(dir, 'Sweden', {'missing: ...'})   write the marker
%   mark_bundle_unverified(dir, 'Sweden', {})                 remove it
%
% WHY THIS EXISTS
%   verify_export_bundle refuses a bundle by raising an error, which is seen by
%   whoever ran that export and by nobody afterwards. The files stay in
%   input/{CC}/MacroModel/, the folder SimPaths reads, and get committed looking
%   exactly like a shippable bundle. The Spain and Sweden bundles were committed
%   that way in 2026-09: complete except for the population projection, which
%   Java treats as optional and silently replaces with its default extrapolation.
%
%   The marker makes the refusal a property of the bundle. Both exporters write
%   it before their first file, so an export that dies partway is marked too,
%   and verify_export_bundle removes it only when the bundle passes.
%   calibrate_growth_model and ramsey_trend write it before they rewrite the
%   bundle's growth_params_{C}.json. MacroModelManager refuses a marked bundle.
%
% The content is deterministic (no timestamp), and the marker is never tracked
% (test_artifact_layout refuses it), so a re-run that writes the same bytes is
% still invisible to git.
