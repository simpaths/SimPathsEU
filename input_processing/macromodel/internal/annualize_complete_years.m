function ann = annualize_complete_years(quarterly, quarter_year, years)
% ANNUALIZE_COMPLETE_YEARS  Mean of each complete calendar year, one column per input series.
%
% A year is kept only when all four of its quarters are present; NaN values
% inside a present quarter are skipped ('omitnan'), which matters for the
% break-even series whose first entry is NaN by construction (its trailing-4Q
% growth term has no history at the handoff).
%
% This existed as three pasted loops, and one of them already differed in its
% omitnan handling, so the panels were not all aggregating the same way.
