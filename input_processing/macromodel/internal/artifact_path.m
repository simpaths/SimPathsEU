% ARTIFACT_PATH  Path of a pipeline artefact, by role.

% Roles:
%   data      inputs the pipeline consumes (Stata exports, NAWRU, demographics)
%   output    series and state the model produces (trends, reference CSV, .mat)
%   logs      diaries and text reports
%   figures   figures written by our own plotting code
%   bundle    the SimPaths-facing export, <input tree>/{CC}/MacroModel (needs 'country'; see model_location)
%
% NAME: deliberately not 'model_file'. That name collided with local variables
% of the same name in run_full_workflow.m and run_detrending_benchmark.m, both
% holding a .mod filename. MATLAB classifies an identifier as a VARIABLE for the
% whole function scope if it is assigned anywhere in the body, so every call in
% those two files parsed as indexing an unassigned variable -- regardless of the
% function existing on the path. checkcode did not flag it, and the unit tests
% passed because none of them calls an entry point. tests/test_name_collisions.m
% now guards the class.
%
% Returns a path RELATIVE to the working directory, deliberately. The working
% directory has to be the model root anyway -- Dynare writes its own output
% into pwd unconditionally and resolves its datafile from there -- so anchoring
% these paths anywhere else would split the artefacts of one run across two
% places. That requirement is checked here rather than surfacing later as a
% file-not-found from whichever reader happened to run first.
