% WRITE_GROWTH_TERMINAL_STATE  Write growth_terminal_state.json for SimPaths.
%
%   info = WRITE_GROWTH_TERMINAL_STATE(growth_mat, output_dir) reads the Ramsey
%   workspace at `growth_mat` and writes the handoff contract that the Java
%   runtime initialises from. Returns a struct describing what was written.
%
% CONTRACT: this is the only writer of growth_terminal_state.json. Both
% export_dynamic_for_simpaths.m (full workflow) and export_ramsey_for_simpaths.m
% (Ramsey-only refresh) call it.
%
% Two copies of this writer existed until 2026-08 and had already diverged: the
% Ramsey-only copy did not emit `projection_quarters`. Java falls back to the
% legacy 320-quarter horizon when that key is missing — with a log warning, but
% the run continues on a different forward horizon than the one the trend was
% solved over. Contract #9 in docs/Integration_Contracts.md exists precisely to
% stop the horizon being a constant on each side; the second writer quietly
% reopened it for anyone following the "Refresh Ramsey Files Only" recipe in
% input_processing/macromodel/README.md.
